# [Little CMS](http://www.littlecms.com) bindings for [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/)

Makes [LCMS C API](https://github.com/mm2/Little-CMS) available in Rust. There's also a [higher-level wrapper](https://github.com/pornel/rust-lcms2).

All function names and arguments are the same. Constant/struct/enum names don't have the `cms` prefix (because Rust has namespacing already!
